The database dump places.sql contains commands to construct the database and its tables. It also adds constraints and checks.

I also added cmdlines.txt to reference some commands entered in shells such as PowerShell and the Amazon Linux AMI command-line interface.

Two key-pairs are used to connect to the EC2/RDS instance:
Nimbus key-pair is used for the EC2 instance.
Nimbus key-pair, silver is used for the RDS database instance.
