The database dump places.sql contains commands to construct the database and its tables. It also adds constraints and checks.

I also added cmdlines.txt to reference some commands entered in shells such as PowerShell and the Amazon Linux AMI command-line interface.

Two key-pairs are used to connect to the EC2/RDS instance:

Nimbus key-pair is used for the EC2 instance.
  
Nimbus key-pair, silver is used for the RDS database instance.

**Prerequisites**

Configuration of the AWS profile on the shell using the `aws configure --profile`` command.

**Importing CSV Instructions and Tips**

To import a .csv file into an EC2 instance, use the command 
`scp -i "my\path\to\my\pem\file.pem" "my\path\to\my\csv\file.csv" ec2-user@ec2-12-345-678-90.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~/.`
where `my\path\to\my\pem\file.pem` is the path to your `.pem` file, `my\path\to\my\csv\file.csv` is the local path to your `.csv` file
and the IP `12-345-678-90` is the IP address of your instance found in the EC2 page details under "Instance Summary" (the main dashboard).

When adding rows, double-quotes aren't used around values because they are used for identifiers such as column names or table names (or any other name).

They are used during CSV import when commas are present in the entry so PostgreSQL knows not to confuse it with a delimitation.

Spaces can be used during a standard INSERT INTO statement because the values are enclosed around quotes. The spaces would not be entered as values.
With a CSV or any other import, the entries are delimited by a value, default comma in CSV files (or tab in TEXT files).
Any data between the delimiters represents an entry. Therefore, spaces cannot be used unless intended to be part of the entry.

Escaping double-quotes is necessary when using double-quotes to escape the comma in a .csv file.

Log-in Instructions

**To the EC2**
To log in to an AWS EC2 instance, use the command `ssh -i my\path\to\my\pem\file.pem ec2-user@ec2-12-345-678-90.compute-1.amazonaws.com`
where `my\path\to\my\pem\file.pem` is the path to your `.pem` file and the IP `12-345-678-90` is the IP address of your instance
found in the EC2 page details under "Instance Summary" (the main dashboard).

 To terminate the connection, type "logout".

**To the RDS**

To log in to the AWS RDS instance within the EC2 instance, use the command 
`psql --host=my.db.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com --port=5432 --dbname=dbname1 --username=postgres` where `my.db` is your database location
found in the RDS page details under "Connectivity and Security" and the dbname1 is the configured database name.

 To terminate the connection, type "exit".

**Database Usage**

`\dt` displays the tables. You can think of `dt` as an abbreviation for "display tables".

A common procedure is to update the table at large. If a .csv file is the source of a database and it gets updated,
you can drop the previous rows and copy the .csv file onto the database:

`TRUNCATE TABLE tablename; -- outputs TRUNCATE TABLE indicating a successful completion of removal of all rows

\copy places (name, address, city, state, country, visited, date_visited, notes) 
FROM '/home/ec2-user/places.csv' 
WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER); -- outputs COPY 35 in the case 35 rows are copied

SELECT * FROM places; -- confirm the table outputs as expected
`

***DO NOT DROP THE TABLE.*** Doing so will require re-configuration of the type of columns and a re-creation of the table.
