Roy de France,701 S Miami Ave #335B,Miami,FL,US,Y,2024-10-17,"The Birthday Cake macaron ice cream was sweeter and less savory than expected. The price of $4.50 was fair, however, and I would return again. This is where R and I met."
Metro Diner,2714 W Osceola Pkwy,Kissimmee,FL,US,Y,2024-11-02,"The service was friendly and welcoming, the prices were a bargain and the food was amongst the most delicious I've ever had."
Black Market Bayside,401 Biscayne Blvd Unit 225-N,Miami,FL,US,Y,2024-10-17,The service was attentive to our needs. The food was filling and the view of the bayside was remarkable.
Venetian Causeway Park,918-930 Venetian Causeway,Miami Beach,FL,US,Y,2024-10-17,We came at nighttime when we were able to enjoy the view of the city from a quiet and peaceful location.
citizenM Miami Worldcenter Hotel Night Swim Rooftop Bar,"700 NE 2nd Ave,11th Floor",Miami,FL,US,Y,2024-10-25,The garlic parmesan tequenos we ordered were hot and fresh. We got to enjoy pop music remixes while watching downtown from the sky.
La Latina,3509 NE 2nd Ave,Miami,FL,US,Y,2024-10-25,"The food came out fast, hot and fresh. We also had their lime cucumber water. She didnt eat much of the arepa."
Rinconcito Cubano,70 NW 107th Ave,Miami,FL,US,Y,2024-10-26,"This was the best restaurant we visited to date because of its service, delicious food and price."
Beach View Park,5301-5313 Collins Ave,Miami Beach,FL,US,Y,2024-10-27,"The park is nice, has bathrooms and is a good place to relax. However, we came for the boardwalk, which we enjoyed walking half a mile north and back. We got to learn about clouds and cactuses."
Citibike,Collins Ave & 5300 Block,Miami Beach,FL,US,Y,2024-10-27,"This was the first time I saw R try to ride a regular bike. She mentioned it was too big for her, but we gave it a shot anyway. We confirmed her claim."
Topgolf Miami - Doral,11850 NW 22nd St,Doral,FL,US,Y,2024-10-29,Topgolf Miami - Doral has improved in terms of appearance and food quality over the last couple of years. They also added a larger driver to their arsenal of clubs.
Rosen Shingle Creek,9939 Universal Blvd,Orlando,FL,US,Y,2024-11-02,The rooms offered a spectacular view of the golf course. We got to see people playing golf. The room service was professional and the hotel spacious and luxurious. It was also well-priced at $100/night!
Super Target,2155 Town Center Blvd,Orlando,FL,US,Y,2024-11-02,This place doubles as a Wal-Mart for its size. Miami's real estate is always in-demand so no Super Targets exist there. It was nice to witness their expanded selection of products.
CVS,13454 S Orange Blossom Trl,Orlando,FL,US,Y,2024-11-02,"This CVS eclipses any found in Miami with regards to quality, organization and cleanliness. We also learned what Orange Blossoms were."
Waffle House,9406 S Orange Blossom Trl,Orlando,FL,US,Y,2024-11-03,This was my first time visiting a Waffle House since I was in college over a decade ago. The sweet waffles and the syrup along with the eggs and bacon brought back cherishable memories that I was able to share with R.
Apna Bazaar,9404 S Orange Blossom Trl,Orlando,FL,US,Y,2024-11-03,This was the first Indian supermarket R and I visited together. She was excited about the selection of products. She bought me a bottle of camel's milk and a bottle of mango lassi.
Lake Eola,512 E Washington St,Orlando,FL,US,Y,2024-11-03,"Lake Eola had swan bikes we were unable to rent because of the windy weather. We were still able to enjoy the picturesque nature, take selfies over the lake deck and observe the birds and turtles."
Alien Treats,101 S Eola Dr #105,Orlando,FL,US,Y,2024-11-03,This was a new dessert bar that just opened up a few months ago. We had forgotten our purchase of candy there as we left it while enjoying their delicious ice cream milkshake. They refunded us and made sure we were attended to. It was the best customer service I had ever received from anywhere. I felt welcome.
Macondo Coffee Roasters,205 Aragon Ave,Coral Gables,FL,US,Y,2024-11-10,"The service here was subpar and the coffee tepid. It's a shame because the food was good, the music at 10am on a Sunday morning was welcoming and the location was fine. This place used to be a tea house, but the prices for the food make it more profitable for the current company. Despite the settling atmosphere I don't think we'll be visiting again."
Miami International Airport,2100 NW 42nd Ave,Miami,FL,US,Y,2024-11-12,I added this location because this instance describes the first time R met my father. They got along well and she spoke to him with her limited Spanish. My dad responded but likewise spoke to her in English.
Embassy Suites - Hilton Boca Raton,661 NW 53rd St,Boca Raton,FL,US,Y,2024-11-16,This was the location of the 22nd Annual Turkey Bowl. I performed well at this tournament only erring after a mental defeat from not knowing how to checkmate with a knight and bishop on my penultimate round. I was strengthened through R's support as she brought snacks and coffee along with her warm company. She made me feel invincible!
the seed. Coffee + Juice Bar,1449 Yamato Rd Ste 1,Boca Raton,FL,US,Y,2024-11-16,"The coffee was fantastic. It's too bad it's offset by the blank face on the employees, the colder-than-iced-coffee service and the lack of salt and pepper. That last one is a blunder, and sure enough won't be re-visiting."
Jersey Mike's Subs,1200 Yamato Rd,Boca Raton,FL,US,Y,2024-11-16,"This was a regular Jersey Mike's that offered delicious and filling sandwiches. It did not disappoint, but I was a bit peeved they wouldn't take my coupon."
BOHEMIAN LATIN GRILL,1199 E Commercial Blvd,Oakland Park,FL,US,Y,2024-11-16,"I loved every second of this visit. R and I danced Salsa, enjoyed the burritos and ice cream and received fantastic service. I will not hesitate to come and visit them again! It reminded R of her bohemian days in San Diego."
Evelyn Greer Park,8200 Sw 124th St,Miami,FL,US,Y,2024-11-23,"Diego's Tournament was filled with many stronger player than I was used to a couple of years ago. Despite R's everlasting support, I did not perform well at the tournament. I attribute this state to fatigue and a lack of rest and recovery from the previous week's tournament along with the Friday Night Lights the night before. It was an instructive experience."
The Muffin Tin Restaurant,12655 S Dixie Hwy,Miami,FL,US,Y,2024-11-23,The service was slow and the food was not worth the $40 we paid. We could have made this ourselves for a fraction of the price. We regretted our decision to spend so much when we could have ate at the nearby fast food restaurants. We had to take our food to go because we ran out of time. It took twenty minutes for the food to come out... We will not return.
Wild Fork,10015 NW 41st St,Doral,FL,US,Y,2024-11-24,"Wild Fork is my favorite meat market and makes the 25-minute drive worth it. However, they did not have oxtail for the third time. This was disconcerting... We will visit again but if they do not have the oxtails we will have to visit the nearby meat market as well."
Walmart Supercenter,8651 NW 13th Terrace,Doral,FL,US,Y,2024-11-24,Walmart was full as usual on a Sunday evening. The crowd made a difference and provided a sufficient amount of anxiety. Not having a grocery list was unsettling. From here on R and I downloaded Anylist and began collaboration.
Subway,8686 NW 13th Terrace,Doral,FL,US,Y,2024-11-24,"This Subway did not have cheddar cheese for my steak sandwich. It felt pointless coming here but R still enjoyed the meal. I was not full and, in my fasted, hungry state, ate more food upon arriving home. Subway doesn't fill me up because it's bread with small amounts of protein."
Publix Super Market at Plaza de Leon,106 Ponce de Leon,Coral Gables,FL,US,Y,2024-11-24,"I liked visiting this Publix by my residence. The only complaint is the prices, but that applies to all Publix supermarkets nowadays."
Medium Cool Cocktail Lounge,1690 Collins Ave #2,Miami Beach,FL,US,Y,2024-11-27,"R loved the atmosphere and vibe of the lounge. I like visiting this place to dance, although I don't do so anymore. It feels like a getaway place where worries evaporate into the beat of the music."
Salt & Straw,749 Lincoln Rd,Miami Beach,FL,US,Y,2024-11-27,"This was when I first picked up Bengali and began speaking it in public with the phrase, ""Ami ekta mohila!"" (I am a woman!) She loved the ice cream, date and time spent this evening."
Sedano's Supermarket,4803 SW 8th St,Miami,FL,US,Y,2024-11-28,We visited the only open supermarket on Thanksgiving. There weren't many people and we were able to find what we were looking for even if the prices were a bit higher than usual compared to Wal-mart.
Tropical Park,7900 Sw 40th St,Miami,FL,US,Y,2024-11-30,We came to play racquetball at the tennis courts. There were too many teenagers due to the Christmas Wonderland Holiday Amusement Park. I was turned off and so was R at the lack of indoor courts. It's a nice park during the day.
Flagler Park Plaza,8219 W Flagler St,Miami,FL,US,Y,2024-11-30,"This place was fantastic. We got to got to Burlington's, Uptown Buffet and Dollar Tree all in the same night. It was also my first time visiting Burlington's and Dollar Tree. We will re-visit again."
Phillips Park,90 Menores Ave,Coral Gables,FL,US,Y,2024-12-1,We were able to play racquetball in peace. The only other people in the park were playing soccer. There were no people playing pickleball. It was refreshing...
