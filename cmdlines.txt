# Transfer file using SCP over TCP Port 22 from local machine to Amazon Linux AMI remote machine (hereafter referred to as Nimbus, the name of the EC2 instance)
# The first option, -i followed by its parameter authenticates the user's connection to Nimbus.
# The next parameter is the file, then establishing a connection to the public DNS (IPv4 or IPv6) for access to the home directory of the instance as a default user.
# Note the fictitious ip 123.45.67.89: The public DNS of the instance should be kept private for prevention of unauthorized access attempts.
